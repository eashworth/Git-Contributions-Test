# Git Contributions Test

A repo created in an attempt to resolve an issue where commits pushed to the React-To-Do-List repo are not showing as contributions despite the author email address matching that of my Github account.

Pushes to this test repo will demonstrate whether the problem is confined to the React-To-Do-List repo or affects others.

Update following first commit:

The first commit to this repo showed as a contribution immediately. It appears the problem is confined solely to the React-To-Do-List repo.
